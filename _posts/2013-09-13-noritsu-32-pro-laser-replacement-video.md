title: Video - Noritsu 32 Pro Laser Replacement
description: Our Noritsu 32 Pro was giving us some random yellow lines on prints once in a while. After swapping AOM Drivers (silver boxes) and laser 	power supplies we decided to replace the laser with a refurb from PTS (http://www.ptscsg.com/).

The video is 10 seconds per frame I think - actual elapsed time was 84 minutes. Recorded on an iPod Touch 5 with the TimeLapse app.

This is the 3rd time I have had this laser out recently - first laser was bad, so took it out and put the old one in again for a few weeks, then replaced it again with this one. The first time I did it took a little longer - probably 3 hours total.

I lost a screw at one point, that is what is going on with the flash light... never found it, but I think it was not too important, it was holding a plastic guide in place.

The video ends as I figure out I left out a plug - but by then I was almost done. Took another 20 minutes or so to finish.

I had to replace the laser power supplies (2 small circuit boards on the side of the laser) because the laser I got from PTS is a little different than the original. Mine originally was an AA I think, this one is a B something - not sure.

The yellow lines on the prints sort of looked like a wood grain pattern, and would mostly be on the first print of any batch. So we would send 3-4 of the first one and hope to get one good one. In the middle of any batch they would usually be fine.
