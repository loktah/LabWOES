Symptoms prior to replacing were laser errors in the morning, and big fluctuations in setup prints.

Total time to remove and replace the laser was about 3 hours with someone talking him thru what to do. He was able to do it by himself. The laser itself is fairly heavy, maybe 25-30 pounds.

He used http://www.ptscsg.com/ for the refurb.
