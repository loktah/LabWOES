<p>GitHub has an 'Issues' tab inside any given project, and I use that as a simple forum of sorts to keep track of problems I have and their solutions if I find them.</p>
<p>Anyone is welcome to use it, you can signup for a free GH account and then have access to either create a new Issue, or leave a comment on an existing Issue.</p>
