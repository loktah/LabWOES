*Unofficial ROES and LabWorks forum for Photo Labs.*

Forum? well, not really. Just using GitHub's "Issues" as a free forum. 

My Name is Ron, and I own a [Photo Lab in San Diego called ProLabPrints.com/ Fromex Photo Lab](http://prolabprints.com). I enjoy tech stuff and helping others, and am usually frustrated that there is no user forum for ROES. I think the ROES people do an amazing job of support, but sometimes I feel like some things could be more easily done thru a forum. That said I have several better things to do than create a forum and manage users, so I figured I would try posting my issues here, and if others wish to join in great. Otherwise it may just be my own list of issues encountered for future reference.

If you want to join in, all you need is a [GitHub account (free)](https://github.com/join) and then you should be able to create an issue, or reply to an existing one.

The link to "Issues" is one of the tabs above - next to Code. [Here is the link to them](https://github.com/rdyar/LabWOES/issues)
